## 1. Introduction

The `xiaozhi-esp32-server` project is a **comprehensive backend system** designed to support intelligent hardware based on ESP32. Its core goal is to enable developers to quickly build a robust server infrastructure that can understand natural language commands, interact efficiently with various AI services (for speech recognition, natural language understanding, and speech synthesis), manage IoT devices, and provide a web-based user interface for system configuration and management. By integrating multiple cutting-edge technologies into a cohesive and extensible platform, this project aims to simplify and accelerate the development process of customizable voice assistants and intelligent control systems. It is not just a simple server, but a bridge connecting hardware, AI capabilities, and user management.

---

## 2. Overall Architecture

The `xiaozhi-esp32-server` system adopts a **distributed, multi-component collaborative** architectural design, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Each core component has its specific role and works in coordination. The main components include:

1.  **ESP32 Hardware (Client Device):**
    This is the physical smart hardware device that end-users directly interact with. Its main responsibilities include:
    *   Capturing user voice commands.
    *   Securely sending captured raw audio data to `xiaozhi-server` for processing.
    *   Receiving synthesized voice responses from `xiaozhi-server` and playing them through speakers.
    *   Controlling other connected peripherals or IoT devices (such as smart bulbs, sensors, etc.) based on instructions received from `xiaozhi-server`.

2.  **`xiaozhi-server` (Core AI Engine - Python Implementation):**
    This Python-based server is the "brain" of the entire system, responsible for handling all voice-related logic and AI interactions. Its key responsibilities are detailed as follows:
    *   Establishing **stable, low-latency real-time bidirectional communication links** with ESP32 devices through the WebSocket protocol.
    *   Receiving audio streams from ESP32 and using Voice Activity Detection (VAD) technology to precisely segment valid speech segments.
    *   Integrating and calling Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) services (configurable for local or cloud), converting speech segments to text.
    *   Interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse user intent, generate intelligent responses, and support complex natural language understanding tasks.
    *   Managing context information and user memory in multi-turn dialogues to provide coherent interaction experiences.
    *   Calling Text-to-Speech (TTS) services to synthesize natural and fluent speech from LLM-generated text responses.
    *   Executing custom commands through a flexible **plugin system**, including IoT device control logic.
    *   Obtaining its detailed runtime operation configuration from the `manager-api` service.

3.  **`manager-api` (Management Backend - Java Spring Boot Implementation):**
    This is an application built using the Java Spring Boot framework, providing a secure RESTful API for system management and configuration. It serves not only as the backend support for the `manager-web` console but also as the configuration data source for `xiaozhi-server`. Its core functions include:
    *   Providing user authentication (login, permission verification) and user account management functions for the Web console.
    *   Registration, information management of ESP32 devices, and maintenance of device-specific configurations.
    *   Persistently storing system configurations in the **MySQL database**, such as user-selected AI service providers, API keys, device parameters, plugin settings, etc.
    *   Providing specific API endpoints for `xiaozhi-server` to pull its required latest configuration.
    *   Managing TTS voice options, handling OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware update processes, and related metadata.
    *   Utilizing **Redis** as a high-speed cache to store hotspot data (such as session information, frequently accessed configurations) to improve API response speed and overall system performance.

4.  **`manager-web` (Web Control Panel - Vue.js Implementation):**
    This is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue.js, providing system administrators with a graphical, user-friendly operation interface. Its main capabilities include:
    *   Conveniently configuring various AI services used by `xiaozhi-server` (such as ASR, LLM, TTS provider switching, parameter adjustment).
    *   Managing platform user accounts, role assignment, and permission control.
    *   Managing registered ESP32 devices and their related settings.
    *   (Potential functionality) Monitoring system operation status, viewing logs, troubleshooting, etc.
    *   Comprehensive interaction with all backend management functions provided by `manager-api`.

**High-Level Interaction Flow Overview:**

*   **Voice Interaction Main Line:** After the **ESP32 device** captures user voice, it transmits audio data in real-time to **`xiaozhi-server`** through **WebSocket**. After `xiaozhi-server` completes a series of AI processing (VAD, ASR, LLM interaction, TTS), it sends the synthesized voice response back to the ESP32 device for playback through WebSocket. All real-time interactions directly related to voice are completed in this link.
*   **Management Configuration Main Line:** Administrators access the **`manager-web`** console through a browser. `manager-web` executes various management operations (such as modifying configurations, managing users or devices) by calling **RESTful HTTP interfaces** provided by **`manager-api`**. Data is passed between them in JSON format.
*   **Configuration Synchronization:** **`xiaozhi-server`** actively pulls its latest operation configuration from **`manager-api`** through HTTP requests when starting or when specific update mechanisms are triggered. This ensures that configuration changes made by administrators in the Web interface can be effectively applied to the operation of the core AI engine in a timely manner.

This **frontend-backend separation, core service and management service separation** architectural design allows `xiaozhi-server` to focus on efficient real-time AI processing tasks, while `manager-api` and `manager-web` together provide a powerful and easy-to-use management and configuration platform. Each component has clear responsibilities, facilitating independent development, testing, deployment, and expansion.

## 3. Component Deep Dive

### 3.1. `xiaozhi-server` (Core AI Engine - Python Implementation)

The `xiaozhi-server` is the intelligent core of the system, responsible for processing voice interactions, interfacing with AI services, and managing communication with ESP32 devices.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To provide real-time processing of voice commands from ESP32 devices.
    *   To integrate with various AI services for Speech-to-Text (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (via Large Language Models - LLMs), Text-to-Speech (TTS), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Intent Recognition, and Memory.
    *   To manage dialogue flow and context with users.
    *   To execute custom functions and control IoT devices based on user commands.
    *   To be dynamically configurable through the `manager-api`.

*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **Python 3:** The primary programming language.
    *   **Asyncio:** Python's asynchronous programming framework, crucial for handling concurrent WebSocket connections and non-blocking I/O for AI service API calls.
    *   **`websockets` Library:** For WebSocket server implementation.
    *   **HTTP Client (e.g., `aiohttp`, `httpx`):** For asynchronous HTTP requests to `manager-api` and external AI services.
    *   **YAML (PyYAML):** For local configuration file parsing.

*   **Key Implementation Aspects:**

    1.  **AI Service Provider Pattern (`core/providers/`):**
        *   **Concept:** A flexible design for integrating AI services. Each service type (ASR, TTS, LLM, etc.) has an abstract base class defining a common interface. Concrete classes implement this interface for specific vendors or local models.
        *   **Benefit:** Allows easy switching of AI service backends via configuration and simplifies adding new service integrations.
        *   **Initialization:** `core/utils/modules_initialize.py` acts as a factory to load and instantiate configured providers.

    2.  **WebSocket Communication & Connection Handling (`core/websocket_server.py`, `core/connection.py`):**
        *   **Server Setup:** Manages WebSocket connections from ESP32 devices.
        *   **Connection Isolation:** Each ESP32 client gets a dedicated `ConnectionHandler` instance, isolating its session state and dialogue.
        *   **Dynamic Configuration Updates:** Can fetch updated configurations from `manager-api` and re-initialize AI service modules live, without a full server restart.

    3.  **Message Handling & Dialogue Flow (`core/handle/`):**
        *   Employs a modular handler pattern. The `ConnectionHandler` dispatches message processing to specialized modules based on message type or dialogue phase (e.g., `receiveAudioHandle.py` for audio input, `intentHandler.py` for NLU, `functionHandler.py` for plugin execution, `sendAudioHandle.py` for TTS output).

    4.  **Plugin System for Extensible Functions (`plugins_func/`):**
        *   **Purpose:** Allows adding custom "skills" (e.g., weather, news, Home Assistant control).
        *   **Mechanism:** Plugins define functions and schemas. The LLM can request execution of these functions (function calling). `loadplugins.py` and `register.py` manage plugin discovery and registration.

    5.  **Configuration Management (`config/`):**
        *   Loads settings from a local `config.yaml` and merges them with configurations fetched from `manager-api` (via `manage_api_client.py`), enabling remote dynamic configuration.
        *   `logger.py` sets up structured application logging.
        *   `config/assets/` stores predefined audio files for system notifications.

    6.  **Auxiliary HTTP Server (`core/http_server.py`):**
        *   Handles specific HTTP requests, notably for OTA firmware updates (`/xiaozhi/ota/`) and other utility endpoints.

### 3.2. `manager-api` (Management Backend - Java Spring Boot Implementation)

The `manager-api` component is a backend server built using Java and the Spring Boot framework, serving as the administrative hub.

*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **Java 21 & Spring Boot 3:** Core language and framework.
    *   **Spring MVC:** For building REST controllers.
    *   **MyBatis-Plus:** ORM for database interaction with MySQL.
    *   **MySQL:** Relational database.

    *   **Liquibase:** Database schema migration.
    *   **Knife4j:** OpenAPI (Swagger) API documentation.
    *   **Maven:** Build and dependency management.

*   **Key Implementation Aspects:**

    1.  **Modular Architecture (`modules/` package):**
        *   Business logic is organized into distinct modules (e.g., `sys` for users/roles, `agent` for assistant configs, `device` for ESP32s, `config` for `xiaozhi-server` settings, `security`, `timbre`, `ota`).
        *   Each module typically follows a layered pattern: Controller, Service, DAO (Mapper), Entity, DTO.

    2.  **Layered Architecture:**
        *   **Controller Layer (`@RestController`):** Defines API endpoints, handles HTTP request/response.
        *   **Service Layer (`@Service`):** Contains business logic, transaction management.
        *   **Data Access Layer (MyBatis-Plus Mappers):** Interacts with the MySQL database.

    3.  **Common Functionalities (`common/` package):**
        *   Provides shared code: base classes, global configurations (Spring, MyBatis, Redis, Knife4j), custom annotations (e.g., `@LogOperation`), AOP aspects, global exception handling, utility classes, and XSS protection.

    4.  **Security (Apache Shiro):**
        *   Manages user authentication and permissions for accessing API endpoints. Configured with Shiro Realms and security filters.

    5.  **Database Schema Management (Liquibase):**
        *   Ensures consistent database structure across environments through versioned schema changes.

### 3.3. `manager-web` (Web Control Panel - Vue.js Implementation)

The `manager-web` is a Single Page Application (SPA) providing the administrative user interface.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Offer a web-based control panel for system configuration and management.
    *   Enable administrators to configure `xiaozhi-server`'s AI services, manage users and devices, customize voice timbres, and handle OTA updates.

*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   **Vue.js 2 & Vue CLI:** Core JavaScript framework and build tools.
    *   **Vue Router:** For client-side routing within the SPA.
    *   **Vuex:** For centralized state management.
    *   **Element UI:** UI component library for a consistent look and feel.
    *   **SCSS:** CSS preprocessor.
    *   **HTTP Client (Flyio or Axios):** For API calls to `manager-api`.
    *   **Workbox:** For PWA features (caching, service worker).
    *   **Opus Libraries:** For potential in-browser audio recording/playback.

*   **Key Implementation Aspects:**

    1.  **SPA Structure:** Single HTML page with dynamic view updates.
    2.  **Component-Based Architecture:** UI built from reusable Vue components (`.vue` files in `src/views/` for pages and `src/components/` for smaller elements).
    3.  **Client-Side Routing (`src/router/index.js`):** Maps browser URLs to view components, with route guards for authentication.
    4.  **State Management (`src/store/index.js`):** Vuex manages global state (user info, device lists, etc.) via state, getters, mutations, and actions (often involving API calls).
    5.  **API Communication (`src/apis/`):** Modularized API service files make asynchronous calls to `manager-api`.
    6.  **Build Process & PWA Features:** Vue CLI (Webpack) bundles assets. Workbox enables PWA features like caching.
    7.  **Environment Configuration (`.env` files):**
        *   The `.env` (and `.env.development`, `.env.production`, etc.) files in the project root directory are used to define environment variables. These variables (such as `VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL` to specify the base URL of `manager-api`) can be accessed in the application code through `process.env.VUE_APP_XXX`, allowing configuration of different parameters for different build environments (development, testing, production).

`manager-web` constructs a powerful, maintainable, and user-friendly management interface through the comprehensive application of these technologies, providing solid frontend support for the configuration and monitoring of the `xiaozhi-esp32-server` system.

## 4. Data Flow and Interaction Mechanisms

The `xiaozhi-esp32-server` system coordinates work through well-defined data flows and interaction protocols between components. The main communication methods rely on WebSocket protocol optimized for real-time interaction and RESTful API suitable for client-server requests.

**4.1. Core Voice Interaction Flow (ESP32 Device <-> `xiaozhi-server`)**

This flow is real-time, primarily using WebSocket for low-latency, bidirectional data exchange.

*   **Communication Protocol Documentation:**
    *   Detailed communication protocol documentation can be accessed at: https://ccnphfhqs21z.feishu.cn/wiki/M0XiwldO9iJwHikpXD5cEx71nKh
    *   This document details the WebSocket communication protocol between ESP32 devices and `xiaozhi-server`, including:
        *   Connection establishment and handshake process
        *   Audio data transmission format
        *   Control command format
        *   Status report format
        *   Error handling mechanism

*   **Connection Establishment and Handshake:**
    *   The ESP32 device, as a client, actively initiates a WebSocket connection request to the specified endpoint of `xiaozhi-server` (e.g., `ws://<server-IP>:<WebSocket-port>/xiaozhi/v1/`).
    *   `xiaozhi-server` (`core/websocket_server.py`) receives the connection and instantiates an independent `ConnectionHandler` object for each successfully connected ESP32 device to manage the entire lifecycle of that session.
    *   After the connection is established, an initial handshake process may be executed (handled by `core/handle/helloHandle.py`) to exchange device identification, authentication information, protocol version, or basic status.

*   **Audio Uplink Transmission (ESP32 -> `xiaozhi-server`):**
    *   After a user speaks to the ESP32 device, the device's microphone captures raw audio data (usually in PCM or compressed formats like Opus).
    *   The ESP32 pushes these audio data chunks as WebSocket **binary messages** in real-time to the corresponding `ConnectionHandler` in `xiaozhi-server`.
    *   The server-side `core/handle/receiveAudioHandle.py` module is responsible for receiving, buffering, and processing these audio data.

*   **AI Core Processing (within `xiaozhi-server`):**
    *   **VAD (Voice Activity Detection):** `receiveAudioHandle.py` uses the configured VAD provider (such as SileroVAD) to analyze the audio stream, accurately identifying the start and end points of speech, filtering out silent or noise segments.
    *   **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition):** Detected valid speech segments are sent to the configured ASR provider (local such as FunASR, or cloud services). The ASR engine converts audio signals into text strings.
    *   **NLU/LLM (Natural Language Understanding/Large Language Model):** The ASR output text, along with the current dialogue context history obtained from the Memory provider, and the description schemas of available functions (tools) loaded from `plugins_func/`, are passed to the configured LLM provider.
    *   **Function Call Execution (if LLM decides needed):** If the LLM analysis determines that an external function needs to be called (e.g., querying weather, controlling home appliances), it generates a structured function call request. `core/handle/functionHandler.py` receives this request, finds and executes the corresponding Python function defined in `plugins_func/`, and returns the function's execution result to the LLM. The LLM then generates the final natural language response based on this result.
    *   **Response Generation:** The LLM synthesizes all information (user input, context, function call results, etc.) to generate the final text response.
    *   **Memory Update:** The current round of interaction (user question, LLM response, possible function calls) is processed by the Memory provider to update the dialogue history for subsequent interactions.
    *   **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** The final text response generated by the LLM is sent to the configured TTS provider, which synthesizes the text into a speech data stream (e.g., MP3 or WAV format).

*   **Audio Downlink Response (`xiaozhi-server` -> ESP32):**
    *   The speech data stream synthesized by the TTS provider is sent in real-time as WebSocket **binary messages** back to the ESP32 device through the `core/handle/sendAudioHandle.py` module.
    *   The ESP32 device receives these audio data chunks and immediately plays them to the user through the speaker.

*   **Control and Status Messages (Bidirectional):**
    *   In addition to audio streams, ESP32 and `xiaozhi-server` also exchange **text messages** through WebSocket, these messages are usually encapsulated in JSON format.
    *   **ESP32 -> Server:** The device may send status reports (such as network conditions, microphone status), error codes, or specific control commands (e.g., "stop TTS playback" triggered by user button press).
    *   **Server -> ESP32:** The server may send control instructions to the device (such as "start listening", "stop listening", adjust sensitivity, send specific configuration parameters).
    *   Modules like `core/handle/abortHandle.py` (handling interrupt requests), `core/handle/reportHandle.py` (handling device reports) are responsible for parsing and responding to these control/status messages.

**4.2. Management and Configuration Flow (`manager-web` <-> `manager-api` <-> `xiaozhi-server`)**

This flow primarily relies on HTTP/HTTPS-based RESTful API for request-response interactions.

*   **Administrator UI Backend Interaction (`manager-web` -> `manager-api`):**
    *   When administrators perform operations in the `manager-web` interface (e.g., saving a configuration, adding a new user, registering an ESP32 device):
        *   The Vue.js frontend application (`manager-web`) will initiate asynchronous HTTP requests (usually GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the corresponding REST API endpoints of `manager-api` through its API encapsulation module (located in `src/apis/module/`).
        *   Request and response bodies typically use JSON format.
        *   The `@RestController` classes in `manager-api` receive these requests. The **Apache Shiro** framework will first perform authentication and authorization checks on the requests.
        *   After verification, the Controller distributes the request to the corresponding Service layer to handle business logic. The Service layer may interact with the MySQL database (through MyBatis-Plus) and may utilize Redis for data caching.
        *   After processing, `manager-api` returns an HTTP response in JSON format to `manager-web`.
        *   `manager-web` updates its Vuex state store and user interface display based on the response results.

*   **Configuration Synchronization (`manager-api` -> `xiaozhi-server`):**
    *   The operation of `xiaozhi-server` depends on dynamic configurations obtained from `manager-api` (such as currently selected AI service providers and their API keys).
    *   **Pull Mechanism:** The `config/manage_api_client.py` module within `xiaozhi-server`, when the server starts or through specific update triggers (e.g., when `WebSocketServer.update_config()` is called), will initiate an HTTP GET request to a specified endpoint of `manager-api` (e.g., provided by a Controller in `modules/config/controller/`).
    *   `manager-api` responds to this request, returning the configuration data required by `xiaozhi-server` (in JSON format).
    *   After receiving the configuration, `xiaozhi-server` will update its internal state and may reinitialize relevant AI service modules to make the new configuration effective.

*   **OTA Firmware Update Flow (Conceptual Description):**
    *   Administrators upload new ESP32 firmware packages to specific endpoints of `manager-api` through the `manager-web` interface.
    *   `manager-api` stores the firmware files and records related metadata (version number, applicable device models, etc.).
    *   When administrators trigger OTA updates for specific devices:
        *   `manager-api` may notify `xiaozhi-server` (the specific notification mechanism may be a polling checkpoint, or `xiaozhi-server` exposes an API to receive update notifications, or more loosely coupled like message queues).
        *   `xiaozhi-server` can then send an instruction message containing the firmware download URL to the target ESP32 device through WebSocket.
        *   After receiving the instruction, the ESP32 device downloads the firmware through an HTTP GET request from that URL. This URL may point to a path served by the `SimpleHttpServer` running on `xiaozhi-server` itself (such as `/xiaozhi/ota/`), or in some architectures, it may directly point to `manager-api` or a dedicated file server.

**4.3. Main Protocol Summary:**

*   **WebSocket:** Selected for the communication link between ESP32 and `xiaozhi-server` because it is very suitable for real-time, low-latency, bidirectional data stream transmission (especially audio), as well as asynchronous control message delivery.
*   **RESTful APIs (based on HTTP/HTTPS, usually using JSON as the data exchange format):** This is the standard way for web service communication. Used for request-response interactions between `manager-web` (client) and `manager-api` (server), and also for `xiaozhi-server` (as client) to pull configuration information from `manager-api` (as server). Its stateless nature, wide library support, and easy-to-understand semantics make it an ideal choice for such interactions.

This multi-protocol communication strategy ensures that different types of interaction requirements within the system can be handled efficiently and appropriately, balancing real-time performance and standardized request-response patterns.

## 6. Deployment and Configuration Overview

The `xiaozhi-esp32-server` system is designed with flexibility in mind, providing multiple deployment methods and comprehensive configuration options to adapt to different usage scenarios and requirements.

**Deployment Options:**

The project can be deployed in multiple ways, mainly including using Docker to simplify the installation process, or deploying directly from source code for greater control and development.

1.  **Docker-based Deployment:**
    *   **Simplified Installation (Only `xiaozhi-server`):** This option only deploys the core Python-based `xiaozhi-server`. It is suitable for users who mainly need voice AI processing capabilities and IoT control, without requiring the complete Web management interface and database support functions (such as OTA). In this mode, configuration is typically managed through local files (`config.yaml`), but if needed, it can still point to an existing `manager-api` instance.
    *   **Full Module Installation (All Components):** This scheme deploys all core components: `xiaozhi-server`, Java-based `manager-api`, and Vue.js-based `manager-web`, along with required database services (MySQL and Redis). This provides a complete system experience, including a Web control panel for comprehensive configuration and management.
    *   The project provides `Dockerfile` definitions for each service and uses `docker-compose.yml` files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` for basic version, `docker-compose_all.yml` for full-featured version) to orchestrate and manage multi-container deployment. Additionally, a `docker-setup.sh` script may be provided to assist in automating part of the Docker environment setup work.

2.  **Source Code Deployment:**
    *   This method requires manual setup of the corresponding development environment for each component: Python environment for `xiaozhi-server`, Java/Maven environment for `manager-api`, Node.js/Vue CLI environment for `manager-web`.
    *   For full module installation, MySQL and Redis database services also need to be manually installed and configured.
    *   This approach is typically used for project development, deep customization, debugging, or in production scenarios with special environmental requirements.

**Configuration Management:**

Configuration is key to customizing system behavior, especially in selecting AI service providers and managing API keys.

1.  **`xiaozhi-server` Configuration:**
    *   **Local `config.yaml`:** A main YAML format configuration file located in the `xiaozhi-server` root directory. It defines server ports, selected AI service providers (ASR, LLM, TTS, VAD, Intent Recognition, Memory modules, etc.), their respective API keys or model paths, plugin configurations, and log levels.
    *   **Remote Configuration through `manager-api`:** `xiaozhi-server` is designed to obtain its operation configuration from `manager-api`. Settings obtained from `manager-api` typically override settings with the same name in the local `config.yaml`. This brings two major benefits:
        *   **Centralized Management:** All configurations can be managed uniformly through the `manager-web` interface.
        *   **Dynamic Updates:** `xiaozhi-server` can refresh its configuration and reinitialize AI modules without completely restarting the service.
    *   `config/config_loader.py` and `config/manage_api_client.py` in `xiaozhi-server` are responsible for handling configuration loading, merging, and pulling logic from `manager-api`.

2.  **`manager-api` Configuration:**
    *   As a Spring Boot application, its configuration is mainly managed through the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.
    *   Key configuration items include: database connection information (MySQL URL, username, password), Redis server address and port, application service port (default 8002), Apache Shiro security-related settings, and configuration parameters for any integrated third-party services (such as Aliyun SMS).

3.  **`manager-web` Configuration:**
    *   Environment-specific settings for the Vue.js frontend application are managed through `.env` series files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`) in the project root directory.
    *   The most critical configuration here is usually the API base URL address of the `manager-api` backend (e.g., `VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL`), to which the frontend application will send all API requests.

4.  **Predefined Configuration Schemes:**
    *   The project documentation (usually README) will recommend some common configuration combinations, for example:
        *   **"Entry Level Free Settings":** This scheme aims to utilize free tier quotas of cloud AI services or completely free local models to minimize users' initial usage costs and operating expenses.
        *   **"Full Streaming Configuration":** This scheme prioritizes system response speed and interaction fluency, typically choosing AI services that support streaming processing (possibly paid).
    *   These predefined schemes provide guidance for users to configure AI service providers in `xiaozhi-server` (through the `manager-web` interface or directly modifying `config.yaml`).

In the case of full module deployment, it is recommended to use the `manager-web` control panel as the main operation interface for most configuration tasks, as it provides a user-friendly way to manage various settings that are persisted by `manager-api` and ultimately used by `xiaozhi-server`.
